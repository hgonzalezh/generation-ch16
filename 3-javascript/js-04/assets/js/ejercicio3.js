Exercise #3

Write while loops to do the following:

– Repeatedly print the value of the variable xValue, decreasing it by 0.5 each time,
as long as xValue remains positive.

- Print all the odd numbers between 1 - 100.

- Write a method with a while loop to print 1 through n in square brackets. 
For example, if n = 6 print [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]

- Write a method with a while loop that computes the sum of first n positive integers: 
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + … + n
Examples:
n = 5 sum = 15
n = 19 sum = 190
